# Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor

## What is this project?
The Neural Signal Generator and Processor is a research project about the human brain. It focuses on generating waves that an electroencephalogram (EEG) would interpret and then process.

## Scientific Motivation
Real EEG acquisition presents some challenges, including high noise levels, hardware costs, and limited accessibility for early-stage research.  
This project explores computational approaches for generating and analyzing artificial neural signals, aiming to create a controlled environment for experimentation, analysis, and hypothesis testing related to neural activity.

## Research Approach
This project follows an exploratory and modular research approach.  
Different signal generation and processing strategies are investigated and evaluated over time, allowing the project to evolve as new ideas, tools, and insights emerge.

## Project Status
Early-stage research and development.

Current focus: artificial neural signal generation and low-level processing.
