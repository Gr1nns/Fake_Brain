# Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor

## What is this project?
The **Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor** is a computational research project inspired by the human brain, focused on the generation, processing, and analysis of neural signals, particularly EEG-like signals.

# Scientific Motivation
Real EEG acquisition presents several challenges, including high noise levels, hardware costs, and limited accessibility for early-stage research.
