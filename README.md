# Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor

## What is this project?
The Neural Signal Generator and Processor is a research project about the human brain. It focuses on generating waves that an electroencephalogram (EEG) would interpret and then process.

## Scientific Motivation
The motivation for this project stems from the fact that acquiring an EEG device comes with several challenges, such as high noise levels and the cost of the hardware, making it difficult to conduct research on this topic if you cannot purchase an EEG device.

## Research Approach
This project will follow the form of exploratory modular research.
By generating different types of signals and exploring ways to continuously improve, the project is allowed to evolve with new ideas.

## Project Status
Early stages of development.

Trying to create "realistics" neurons to my code.
