# Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor

## What is this project?
The Neural Signal Generator and Processor is a research project about the human brain. It focuses on generating waves that an electroencephalogram (EEG) would interpret and then process.

## Scientific Motivation
The motivation for this project stems from the fact that acquiring an EEG device comes with several challenges, such as high noise levels and the cost of the hardware, making it difficult to conduct research on this topic if you cannot purchase an EEG device.

## Research Approach
This project follows an exploratory and modular research approach.  
Different signal generation and processing strategies are investigated and evaluated over time, allowing the project to evolve as new ideas, tools, and insights emerge.

## Project Status
Early-stage research and development.

Current focus: artificial neural signal generation and low-level processing.
