# Introduction

Understanding neural signals is a major challenge for neuroscience and neuroengineering. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive way to observe brain activity, but acquiring an EEG device has limitations, such as noise, hardware cost, and accessibility.

In this project I demonstrate a computational structure capable of generating and processing artificial neural wave signals. Because it is generated with simulated data, the project aims to provide a controlled environment for testing, exploration, and testing of initial hypotheses related to the generation of neural signals.

The Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor is designed as a long-term research project, evolving through incremental and independently documented stages.
