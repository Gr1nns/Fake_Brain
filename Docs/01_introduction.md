# Introduction

Understanding neural signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and neuroengineering.
Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive way to observe brain activity, but real-world EEG acquisition is often limited by noise, hardware constraints, and accessibility.

This project proposes a computational framework for the generation and low-level processing of artificial neural signals inspired by EEG activity.
By working with simulated data, the project aims to provide a controlled environment for experimentation, exploration, and early-stage hypothesis testing related to neural signal behavior.

The Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor is designed as a long-term research project, evolving through incremental and independently documented stages.
