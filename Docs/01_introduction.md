# Introduction

Understanding neural signals is a major challenge for neuroscience and neuroengineering. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive way to observe brain activity, but acquiring an EEG device has limitations, such as noise, hardware cost, and accessibility.

This project proposes a computational framework for the generation and low-level processing of artificial neural signals inspired by EEG activity.
By working with simulated data, the project aims to provide a controlled environment for experimentation, exploration, and early-stage hypothesis testing related to neural signal behavior.

The Artificial Neural Signal Generator & Processor is designed as a long-term research project, evolving through incremental and independently documented stages.
