# Project Scope

## What this project currently focuses on
- Generation of artificial neural signals inspired by EEG characteristics
- Low-level signal processing and transformation
- Exploratory analysis of signal behavior under different conditions
- Modular and experimental development approach

## What this project does NOT aim to do at this stage
- Clinical diagnosis or medical validation
- Cognitive interpretation or semantic decoding of neural signals
- Real-time brain–computer interface control
- Hardware-dependent EEG acquisition
