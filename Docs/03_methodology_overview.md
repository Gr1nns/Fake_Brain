# Methodology Overview

This project adopts an exploratory and iterative research methodology.
Instead of following a fixed implementation path, different strategies for neural signal generation and processing are explored, tested, and evaluated over time.

Key methodological principles include:
- Modular design, allowing independent experimentation
- Incremental complexity, starting from simple signal models
- Emphasis on reproducibility and documentation
- Continuous refinement based on observed results
