# Methodology Overview

This project will utilize an exploratory approach and iterative research methods. 
Instead of following a fixed path, different strategies for generating and processing neural signals will be explored, tested, and evaluated over time.

Key methodological principles include:
- Modular design, allowing independent experimentation
- Incremental complexity, starting from simple signal models
- Emphasis on reproducibility and documentation
- Continuous refinement based on observed results
