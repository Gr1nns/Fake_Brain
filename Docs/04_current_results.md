# Current Results

At the moment, the project focuses on early experimentation and validation of artificial neural signal generation concepts.

Initial results include:
- Preliminary signal generation experiments
- Visual inspection of signal behavior
- Identification of challenges related to noise and variability

These results are considered exploratory and serve as a foundation for refining future experiments.
Detailed quantitative analysis will be introduced as the project matures.
